welcome to the planet services cheat menu! this is an 100% open-source project for yet ANOTHER gorilla tag cheat menu..!

we are NOT responsible for any bans, using this menu is completely your decision - we make sure everything is undetected, however if you see a moderator OR get reported through meta reporting menu. that is not something we can control!
unless you have other steam accounts to be unbanned, beware while using this menu
